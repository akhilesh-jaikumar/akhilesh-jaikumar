 Hey, I’m Akhilesh Jaikumar  
🧠 Founding Engineer @ PromptCraft | Full‑Stack Developer | API Systems Engineer | AI Craftsman  

✨ The Genesis  
I kicked off my journey automating desktop utilities with Python scripts and quickly became mesmerized by Generative AI—where every prompt feels like a doorway to new possibilities. My obsession with language models and reinforcement learning pushed me to architect end-to-end AI products that marry human intuition with machine precision.

Today, I’m the Founding Engineer at PromptCraft, where I design robust control planes for prompt workflows and build scalable, production‑ready LLM systems that empower teams to innovate faster.
