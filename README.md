### ✨ The Journey So Far  
I started by scripting desktop automations in Python — just to make life easier.  
But what began as curiosity turned into a passion for systems that **think**.  

My path led me deep into the world of **language models**, **agents**, and **prompt control**,  
where architecture matters as much as accuracy.

Today, as **Founding Engineer at Promptsheon**, I’m building the scaffolding for next‑gen AI products —  
tools that make LLMs **safer**, **smarter**, and **shippable**.

---

### 🛠️ What I’m Building  

- 🔧 Architecting **Promptsheon** — a control plane for LLM workflows  
  (versioning, orchestration, compliance)  
- ⚡ Shipping **GenAI‑first SaaS**: scalable, multi‑tenant, edge-native — built on Deno & Supabase  
- 🧠 Engineering **self‑improving systems** — agent pipelines, eval loops, and safety layers
